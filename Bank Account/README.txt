HOW TO RUN PROGRAM:
To run the entire program, navigate to the "BankAccountUI" class and run that class. 

NOTES: 
- Do not delete the text file titled "Bim Bob TransactionLog.txt". This is used for testing purposes for the AccountPageUI
  class. If deleted, the self testing main method would not be able to test the functionality of some methods which assosiate 
  their function with writing or reading from a transaction log text file. Deleting this text file would render the self testing
  main method not be able to accomplish testing some methods. 
- There is no button included on the GUI to read and write a transaction list to/from a file. This is because this process is automated 
  everytime the AccountPageUI is initiated or when a transaction is performed. This was decided as it does not make sense for the user 
  having to manually select to read or write from a file and makes sense if it was automated to whenever a transaction was performed or when 
  the user successfully logs into their account. 
  
 Thank you and hope you enjoy your experience.
